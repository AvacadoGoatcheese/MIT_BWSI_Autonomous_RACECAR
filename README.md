# MIT_BWSI_Autonomous_RACECAR
This is a repository to show code that I wrote in a program with MIT's Lincoln Laboratories, Beaver Works Summer Institute.

Much of the code uses NumPy and OpenCV. Each program will be centered around completing a certain task.

The code is meant to be run on a provided simulation that feeds in the data and allows the program to work with it.
